# 1.1 TermsLang

Termslang is a programming language made by Owen Dechow. It's primary goals can be summed up in two simple simple.

> *Simple & Concise*

Lets take a quick look.

```swift
"My FizzBuzz Program"

func int @main: str[] args {
    loop i: i < 100 {
        let str result = "" ~
        let int i = i + 1 ~

        if i % 3 == 0 {
            updt result += _3Word ~
        } else if i % 5 == 0 {
            updt result += _5Word ~
        } else {
            updt result = i.@str.() ~
        }

        println result ~
    }
}
```

There it is TermsLang. You may notice that every variable is statically typed, and each command within a block starts with a specific keyword or term. This is the essence of concisness in termslang. Furthermore, you may have also noticed a straight forward syntax inspired by Python, C#, and Rust. Termslang strives to have a limited number of keywords and simple syntax: simplicity.

# Getting Started

To get started with termslang you need to download and install it using cargo.

```
cargo install termslang
```

Once it is installed and if you are using VSCode, you can install the [language support package](https://github.com/Owen-Dechow/TermsVsCodeSupport).

To get started from there create a file called `fizzbuzz.tms`.
